## Descriptive Statistics

## Why do we use descriptive statistics?

- Explore the data
- See patterns in the data
- Communicate about the data

## What are the most basic things we need to know?

- What are the variables?
- What is the scope of the data (time, geography, cases)?
- What is the unit of observation?

## What are variables?

- In math (algebra) - a symbol that represents a number
- In science - a characteristic or attribute that can vary across units of observation
- In statistics - a characteristic or attribute that can vary across units of observation
- In R coding - a column in a *data frame*
- In all of the above - something that can take on different values

## What is a unit of observation?

- In science - the entity that is being measured
- In statistics - the entity that is being measured
- In R coding - a row in a *data frame*
- In all of the above - the thing that has the variable measured on/for it

## Putting it together

- Variables are characteristics or attributes that vary across units of observation


## Example

Titanic data

```{r}

# Load Titanic dataset

titanic_data <- as.data.frame(Titanic)

# merge the first three colnames to create a new rowname "Passenger_Type" that combines Class, Sex, and Age

titanic_data <- titanic_data %>%
  unite("Passenger_Type", Class, Sex, Age, sep = "-")

# where survived is No, create a variable called number of deaths that is equal to Freq, otherwise 0

titanic_data <- titanic_data %>%
  mutate(number_of_deaths = ifelse(Survived == "No", Freq, 0))

# drop the Freq column and Survived column

titanic_data <- titanic_data %>%
  select(-Freq, -Survived)

# View the first 8 rows of the dataset
head(titanic_data, 8)

```

- units of observation
- variables: columns

## Wide format

**BEWARE! Not all data is formatted this way!** Sometimes you have to think "is this a variable or a unit of observation?"

For example, the following data on Scandinavian temperatures:

```{r}
# From https://sejdemyr.github.io/r-tutorials/basics/wide-and-long/
# created by SIMON EJDEMYR

# Create long dataset
country_long <- data.frame(
    expand.grid(country = c("Sweden", "Denmark", "Norway"), year = 1994:1996),
    avgtemp = round(runif(9, 3, 12), 0)
    )

# Create wide dataset
country_wide <- data.frame(
    country = c("Sweden", "Denmark", "Norway"),
    avgtemp.1994 = country_long$avgtemp[1:3],
    avgtemp.1995 = country_long$avgtemp[4:6],
    avgtemp.1996 = country_long$avgtemp[7:9])
country_wide 

```

It looks like the unit of observation is country and the variable is a combination of year and temperature. 

## Long Format

If we look at it in long format, it's a little clearer:

```{r}

country_long

```


The variable is average temperature. 


## Country-year format 

```{r}
# change the country_long dataset to a wide dataframe with country-year as the row name and column name  avgtemp
# combine country and year to make the row names
# avgtemp is still the variable
# 9 observations
# do not pivot wider

country_wide2 <- country_long %>%
  unite("country_year", country, year, sep = "-") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = country_year, values_from = avgtemp)

df_long <- country_wide2 |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), 
               names_to = "country_year", 
               values_to = "avg_temp")

df_long <- as.data.frame(df_long)

## Create two variables - high_temp and low_temp by adding a random number between 1 and 5 to avg_temp for high_temp and subtracting a random number between 1 and 5 from avg_temp for low_temp

set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
df_long <- df_long %>%
  mutate(high_temp = avg_temp + sample(1:5, n(), replace = TRUE),
         low_temp = avg_temp - sample(1:5, n(), replace = TRUE))

# sort by country_year

df_long <- df_long %>%
  arrange(country_year)

df_long



```



But the unit of observation is no longer country - it is country-year.

Beware again: This is *wide format* in statistical terms. This is *long format* in R *tidyverse* nomenclature.




## Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency help us:

- reveal patterns
- find the typical measurement
- find the center

## Measures of Central Tendency

**A few numbers that can summarize the center of measurement**

- Mean

- Median

- Mode

## Mean

- Symbol: $\bar{x}$
- Not the middle value
- Not the most common
- The center of mass - the sum above equals the sum below
- Formula is $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum X_i}{n}$
- Read that: The mean of X equals the sum of the observations (i) of X divided by the number (n) of observations. 

## Example A:

A. What is the mean of 1,5,7,9,10,12,18


## Example A:

A. What is the mean of 1,5,7,9,10,12,18


```{r}

A <- c(1,5,7,9,10,12,18)

answer_a1 <- (sum(A)/7)

answer_a2 <- mean(A)

# label this as "produced by sum function" and "produced by mean function"

paste("Mean produced by sum function:", answer_a1)
paste("Mean produced by mean function:", answer_a2)

```

## Example A:

A. What is the mean of 1,5,7,9,10,12,18

Center of mass

```{r}
# demonstrate how the mean is the center of mass with ggplot

library(ggplot2)
df_a <- data.frame(x = A)
ggplot(df_a, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of A with Mean", x = "Value", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()


```




## Example B

B. What is the mean of 10,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,75

## Example B

B. What is the mean of 10,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,75


```{r}
B <- c(10,20,30,35,40,45,50,75,25)

mean_b1 <- (sum(B)/9)

mean_b2 <- mean(B)

mean_b1
mean_b2
```

## Median

 - Midpoint
 - Half observations are greater, half are lower
 - Just count
 - Even observations - midpoint between middle two
 
## Example A
 
 A - 1,5,7,9,10,12,18
 
## Example A:

A. What is the mean of 1,5,7,9,10,12,18

```{r}

# label this as "median of A"

paste("Median of A:", median(A))

```





## Example B

 B - 10,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,75
 
 
## Example B

 B - 10,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,75
 
```{r}
# label this as "median of B"

paste("Median of B:", median(B))


```

## Example B

 B - 10,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,75
 
Midpoint and Center of Mass

```{r}
# demonstrate how the midpoint and center of mass are different with ggplot

library(ggplot2)
df_b <- data.frame(x = B)
ggplot(df_b, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(x)), color = "blue", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of B with Mean and Median", x = "Value", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()




```

## Keep in mind for later
In both of our examples, the mean and median were close but not the same. That isn't always the case. 



## Mode

- Most common value
- Just count

## Examples:

C. 1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7

Answer: 

D. 10,20,30,30,40,40,40,50,50,60,70

Answer:



## Advantages and disadvantages

- Median isn't affected by outliers

- Mean gives the broader picture because it includes the outliers.

- Mode is the only option for *categorical variables*. 


## Variable Types

- Categorical (nominal, ordinal)
- Numerical (interval, ratio)

## Variable Type Examples: Categorical 

- Nominal (Order is meaningless)

        - Gender
        - Race
        - Religion
        - Democrat vs Republican (also binary)

- Ordinal (ORDer matters)

        - Education level
        - Income brackets
        - Likert scale responses
        
- Binary 

        - Yes/No
        - 0/1
        - True/False
        
## Variable Type Examples: Numerical

- Interval (equal intervals, no true zero) *

        - Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit)
        - IQ scores
        - Calendar years
        
- Ratio (equal intervals, true zero) *

        - Height
        - Weight
        - Age
        - Income
        - Kelvin temperature
        
- Discrete (countable values) 

        - Number of children
        - Number of countries in a trade agreement
        - Battle deaths in a conflict
        
        
## Social Science examples

- V-Dem v2x_libdem           → ratio (0-1, true zero = no polyarchy) *
- Polity2 score (-10 to 10)     → interval (0 not "no democracy") *
- Country GDP                   → ratio *
- Year                          → interval 
- Battle deaths (COW)           → ratio/discrete *
- is_autocracy (0/1)            → binary/categorical
- regime_type (dem/au/other)    → nominal categorical
- freedom_level (low/med/high)  → ordinal categorical


## Skewed distribution - when mean and median are different

**The three numbers are often different for the same sample or population.**

Example:

![Negatively skewed, Normal, and Positively Skewed distributions](skewed-curves.png)
